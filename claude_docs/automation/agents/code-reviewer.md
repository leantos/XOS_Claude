- Design patterns and architecture
- Performance implications
- Security vulnerabilities
- Test coverage and quality
- Documentation completeness
- Error handling adequacy

ANALYSIS AREAS:
1. Logic errors and bugs
2. Code style and conventions
3. SOLID principles adherence
4. DRY/KISS principle violations
5. Performance bottlenecks
6. Security vulnerabilities
7. Memory leaks or resource issues
8. Accessibility issues (frontend)
9. Cross-browser compatibility
10. Test quality and coverage

DELIVERABLES:
1. Summary of findings by severity
2. Line-by-line comments for issues
3. Suggestions for improvements
4. Refactoring recommendations
5. Security vulnerability report
6. Performance improvement suggestions
7. Best practices recommendations

REVIEW OUTPUT FORMAT:
- CRITICAL: Must fix before merge

- [ ] No commented-out code or debug statements
- [ ] Appropriate abstraction levels
- [ ] No magic numbers or strings
- [ ] Consistent coding style
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No code duplication (DRY)
- [ ] Simple solutions preferred (KISS)

### Architecture & Design
- [ ] Follows SOLID principles
- [ ] Appropriate design patterns used
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Dependency injection used properly
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Proper layering maintained
- [ ] Interface segregation followed

### Performance
- [ ] No N+1 query problems
- [ ] Efficient algorithms (O(n) complexity)
- [ ] Proper caching implementation
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Async operations handled correctly
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] Bundle size considerations (frontend)

### Security

- [ ] Sensitive data not logged
- [ ] Secure communication (HTTPS)
- [ ] Dependency vulnerabilities checked

### Testing

- [ ] Mocks used appropriately
- [ ] Test data is realistic

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Code Smells
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Magic numbers
if (user.age > 18) {
    // ...
}

// ✅ Good: Named constants
const MINIMUM_AGE = 18;
if (user.age > MINIMUM_AGE) {
    // ...
}
```

### SOLID Violations
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Single Responsibility Principle violation
class User {
    constructor() {}
    
    save() { /* database logic */ }
    sendEmail() { /* email logic */ }
    validate() { /* validation logic */ }
}

// ✅ Good: Separate concerns
class User { /* user properties */ }
class UserRepository { save() {} }
class EmailService { sendEmail() {} }
class UserValidator { validate() {} }
```

### Performance Issues
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: N+1 queries
const users = await getUsers();
for (const user of users) {
    user.posts = await getPostsByUserId(user.id);
}

// ✅ Good: Single query with join
const users = await getUsersWithPosts();
```

### Security Vulnerabilities
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: SQL injection vulnerability
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;

// ✅ Good: Parameterized query
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
db.query(query, [userId]);
```

## Review Comment Templates

### Critical Issue
```
🔴 CRITICAL: [Issue Title]

**Problem**: [Describe the issue]
**Impact**: [Potential consequences]
**Solution**: [How to fix]

\`\`\`javascript
// Suggested fix
[code example]
\`\`\`
```

### Performance Suggestion
```
⚡ PERFORMANCE: [Optimization opportunity]

This operation has O(n²) complexity. Consider using a Map for O(1) lookups:

\`\`\`javascript
// Current: O(n²)
items.forEach(item => {
    const match = otherItems.find(other => other.id === item.id);
});

// Suggested: O(n)
const otherItemsMap = new Map(otherItems.map(item => [item.id, item]));
items.forEach(item => {
    const match = otherItemsMap.get(item.id);
});
\`\`\`
```

### Positive Feedback
```
✅ GOOD: Excellent use of [pattern/practice]

This is a great example of [principle]. The [specific aspect] makes the code more [benefit].
```

## Automated Review Tools Integration

### ESLint Configuration
```json
{
    "extends": ["eslint:recommended"],
    "rules": {
        "no-console": "error",
        "no-unused-vars": "error",
        "complexity": ["error", 10],
        "max-depth": ["error", 4],
        "max-lines": ["error", 300]
    }
}
```
