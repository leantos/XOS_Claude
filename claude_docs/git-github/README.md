- **[github-actions-templates.md](./github-actions-templates.md)** - Production-ready CI/CD workflow templates

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Choose Your Git Workflow
Select the appropriate workflow based on your team size and project requirements:

- **GitHub Flow**: Simple, continuous deployment
  - Best for: Small teams, web applications, continuous deployment
  - Branches: `main` + feature branches
  - Merge strategy: Pull requests with squash merge

- **Git Flow**: Structured release management
  - Best for: Large teams, scheduled releases, desktop applications
  - Branches: `main`, `develop`, `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`
  - Merge strategy: Multiple merge types based on branch type

- **Custom Flow**: Tailored to specific needs
  - Best for: Unique requirements, compliance needs
  - Configurable branch patterns and merge strategies

### 2. Set Up Repository Automation
```bash
# Install pre-commit framework
pip install pre-commit

# Copy configuration from git-automation-guide.md
cp .pre-commit-config.yaml.example .pre-commit-config.yaml

# Install hooks
pre-commit install

# Test the setup
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 3. Configure GitHub Integration
```bash
# Set up GitHub CLI
gh auth login

# Configure repository settings
gh repo edit --enable-issues --enable-projects --enable-wiki

# Set up branch protection
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["ci/test"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=false \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":2}'
```

### 4. Implement CI/CD Pipeline
Choose a template from `github-actions-templates.md` and customize:

```yaml
# Basic CI/CD workflow
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

## üîß Tool Integration

### Essential Tools
- **Git**: Version control system
- **GitHub CLI**: Command-line interface for GitHub
- **Pre-commit**: Git hook management
- **Conventional Commits**: Standardized commit messages
- **Semantic Release**: Automated versioning and releases

### Optional Enhancements
- **Husky**: Git hooks for Node.js projects

## üìä Workflow Examples

### Feature Development
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT authentication middleware"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/user-authentication
gh pr create --title "Add JWT Authentication" --body "Implements JWT-based authentication"
```

### Hotfix Process
```bash
# Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/security-patch

# Fix the issue
git add .
git commit -m "fix(security): patch XSS vulnerability"

# Deploy to staging for testing
git push -u origin hotfix/security-patch

# Create PR to main
gh pr create --title "Security Patch" --body "Fixes XSS vulnerability" --base main

# After approval, merge and deploy
gh pr merge --squash
```

### Release Process
```bash
# Automated release (using semantic-release)
npm run release

# Manual release
./scripts/bump-version.sh minor
git push origin main --tags
gh release create v1.2.0 --generate-notes

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Repository Security
- Enable branch protection rules
- Require signed commits
- Use secrets for sensitive configuration
- Implement security scanning in CI/CD
- Regular dependency updates

### Access Control
- Use least-privilege access
- Implement team-based permissions
- Regular access review and cleanup
- Two-factor authentication enforcement
- Audit logging for compliance

### Code Security
- Pre-commit security hooks
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Secret detection and prevention
- License compliance checking
- Container security scanning

## üìà Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Development Velocity**: Commits per day, PR merge time
- **Code Quality**: Test coverage, code review feedback
- **Release Frequency**: Time between releases, deployment success rate
- **Security**: Vulnerability detection and resolution time
- **Team Productivity**: Review turnaround time, branch lifecycle

### Monitoring Tools
- **GitHub Insights**: Built-in repository analytics
- **Code Climate**: Code quality and maintainability
- **Codecov**: Test coverage tracking
- **Snyk**: Security vulnerability monitoring
- **Linear/Jira**: Project management integration

## ü§ù Team Collaboration

### Communication Patterns
- **Daily Standups**: Progress updates and blockers
- **Code Reviews**: Quality gates and knowledge sharing
- **Release Planning**: Version planning and feature prioritization
